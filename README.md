**COVID-19 Data Analytics Project**

SQL • Excel • Tableau • Data Cleaning • Data Visualization

This project explores global COVID-19 trends using SQL for data analysis, Excel for preprocessing, and Tableau for visualization.
The goal was to examine vaccination trends, death rates, infection metrics, and continent-level patterns.


**🌸 Project Overview**

* Cleaned and prepared global COVID mortality and vaccination datasets (Excel)

* Performed data exploration and metric calculations using SQL

* Created an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize country- and continent-level trends

* Computed rolling vaccination totals, percent vaccinated, and mortality percentages

* Identified countries with the highest infection and death rates


**🌸 Data Cleaning (Excel)**

* Split raw dataset into two tables: CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations

* Verified consistent country/date mappings between tables

* Set data types population, new_cases, and new_deaths fields to floats


**🌸 SQL Analysis**

Performed end-to-end SQL exploration, including:

* Identifying countries with the highest total deaths

* Calculating infection rates relative to population
  
* Measuring vaccination progress over time

* Computing rolling counts of new vaccinations using window functions

* Creating views and temporary tables for reusable analysis

* Aggregating global totals for cases, deaths, and fatality rate

This analysis provided the core metrics used in the final Tableau dashboard.


**🌸 Tableau Dashboard**

The interactive visualization includes:

* Total deaths by continent

* Percent of population infected by country

* Infection vs. mortality comparisons

* Infection trends by country
